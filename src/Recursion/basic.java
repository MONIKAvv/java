//dynamic // heart of dsa,
// work on recursion
//Suppose it like----> a function calls another function


// base condition
// body (things needs to do)
// separate memory takes (calling itself)
// we need recursion ---> 1. It helps us in solving bigger complex problems in simpler way
//2. we can convert recursion solutions into iterations and vise versa (without loop)
//3. Used when Space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.
//4. It helps us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems
