/*
* Time complexity --> Always focus on big number
* --> Always ignores less dominating terms
*
* What do we need to consider when thinking about complexity?
* ->ALways look for worst case complexity
*
*
* Big O and omega notation---> uppper bound and lower bound
* little    O and little Omega ---> stronger , strickly principal , it won't have equals to sign
*

*
*
*
*
* Space Complexity --> space array or something takes plus algo taking space (input and auxiliary space)
